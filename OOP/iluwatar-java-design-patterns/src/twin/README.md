翻译[iluwatar/java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/twin)的twin模式

## Intent
 Twin pattern is a design pattern which provides a standard solution to simulate multiple
 inheritance in java

 `双胞胎模式为java提供了标准的多重继承的解决方案`

## Applicability
Use the Twin idiom when

 * to simulate multiple inheritance in a language that does not support this feature.
 * to avoid certain problems of multiple inheritance such as name clashes.

 * `在不支持多重继承的语音中模拟多重继承`
 * `避免了多重继承的问题：比如名字冲突`
